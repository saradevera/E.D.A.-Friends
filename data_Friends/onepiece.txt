Today has been…just. A day I did not expect. (And not really in a good way.)
Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

Will always be my favorite FRIENDS character 😆🤗💖 https://t.co/hes2KsjfVL
@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character
@Touyarokii Sonic.
What can I say, the dude has been my favorite video game character since my childhood, for his personality, speed, and friends he hangs out with. https://t.co/vEo7EdJNrO

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!
Oh no, this is my friends favorite character… this might be a deal breaker tho😭💀 https://t.co/WUZFIGcpNk

coming from someone who's least favorite character is mafuyu, it's more like this
the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

You are badass, just like her! https://t.co/xhRsDodblY
@melissaCnavia

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz

Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug

I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod.

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀

i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM

Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.

friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.

(before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf

We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

Hey, my friends @TixeeTV and @Stevenator210 are streaming. Be like me and have them pulled open in different tabs and support both at the same time or else your favorite anime character will die &gt;:(

I’m in the Razer Kraken BT - Hello Kitty and Friends Ed . Listening to Ayesha Erotica’s Nasty . Feeling like a shit ton of bricks because I read a fic with major character death (it was my favorite character) (it was a really good Fic)
who's your favorite friends' character?
@ssefnum Who's your favorite Friends character?
@born2burn__ I never thought I'd simp for hashirama and here I am now simping for the first hokage. He's my friends favorite character and I never noticed how handsome hashirama is until I met my new friend at momo con this year. Not to mention hashi is my new comfort character.
@The_ExtraRare Not a dude, but Penelope's my current favorite character of yours. Wondered if there are there any other friends you've drawn in her world?
i was like 8 when I saw the phantom of the opera and he fr was mad annoying in that movie. Phantom character gmt but it was my friends favorite movie n I had a crush on her so I was like ok…I guess this lame brooding nigga could sing
I just made the most perfect &amp; impressive french braid I've ever done and nobody will see it because it is a privilege” and for serving as a Christmas present and it’s probably my favorite Friends character.
Today has been…just. A day I did not expect. (And not really in a good way.)
Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him

Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀

I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.

Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩

Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL

Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.

I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6

Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe
Me to noob friends as he braves LWS3: so you’re going to know my favorite character in the game the moment you see them 

Him upon discovering them: it’s Aurene isn’t it.

My favorite characters in FFXIV are well known to my friends, but I will tell you now that my favorite character in WoW is Garrosh Hellscream. Like my other favs, he does not give a single fuck. https://t.co/bDEr9VfTz8
@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar
Happy Birthday Ichigo! My favorite Bleach character who I’m glad is living a happy life and is able to smile a lot more! I hope you have a great day with your family and friends! 
#Bleach #HappyBirthdayIchigo #黒崎一護生誕祭2022 https://t.co/1lpr32VESQ
Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf

We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

I’m in the Razer Kraken BT - Hello Kitty and Friends Ed . Listening to Ayesha Erotica’s Nasty . Feeling like a shit ton of bricks because I read a fic with major character death (it was my favorite character) (it was a really good Fic)
who's your favorite friends' character?
@ssefnum Who's your favorite Friends character?
@born2burn__ I never thought I'd simp for hashirama and here I am now simping for the first hokage. He's my friends favorite character and I never noticed how handsome hashirama is until I met my new friend at momo con this year. Not to mention hashi is my new comfort character.
@The_ExtraRare Not a dude, but Penelope's my current favorite character of yours. Wondered if there are there any other friends you've drawn in her world?
i was like 8 when I saw the phantom of the opera and he fr was mad annoying in that movie. Phantom character gmt but it was my friends favorite movie n I had a crush on her so I was like ok…I guess this lame brooding nigga could sing
I just made the most perfect &amp; impressive french braid I've ever done and nobody will see it because it is a privilege” and for serving as a Christmas present and it’s probably my favorite Friends character.
Vampire or kill them I love how the MC stayed pure even after needing to kill someone to free his friends spirit honestly such a great read the fact that my favorite character got a happy ending where she raised a kid she rescued from a cult and had a kid of her own was just peak https://t.co/if4qptgJye
Today has been…just. A day I did not expect. (And not really in a good way.)
Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying

I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩

@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

GM 🌞 enjoy your weekend, friends! 

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.

friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

My favorite characters in FFXIV are well known to my friends, but I will tell you now that my favorite character in WoW is Garrosh Hellscream. Like my other favs, he does not give a single fuck. https://t.co/bDEr9VfTz8
@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar
Happy Birthday Ichigo! My favorite Bleach character who I’m glad is living a happy life and is able to smile a lot more! I hope you have a great day with your family and friends! 
#Bleach #HappyBirthdayIchigo #黒崎一護生誕祭2022 https://t.co/1lpr32VESQ
Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf
do you think your favorite fictional character of all time would you like you or want to be friends with you
Playing with friends! :)
I have Darth Vader! My favorite Star Wars character! :D
We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

who's your favorite friends' character?
@ssefnum Who's your favorite Friends character?
@born2burn__ I never thought I'd simp for hashirama and here I am now simping for the first hokage. He's my friends favorite character and I never noticed how handsome hashirama is until I met my new friend at momo con this year. Not to mention hashi is my new comfort character.
@The_ExtraRare Not a dude, but Penelope's my current favorite character of yours. Wondered if there are there any other friends you've drawn in her world?
i was like 8 when I saw the phantom of the opera and he fr was mad annoying in that movie. Phantom character gmt but it was my friends favorite movie n I had a crush on her so I was like ok…I guess this lame brooding nigga could sing
I just made the most perfect &amp; impressive french braid I've ever done and nobody will see it because it is a privilege” and for serving as a Christmas present and it’s probably my favorite Friends character.
Vampire or kill them I love how the MC stayed pure even after needing to kill someone to free his friends spirit honestly such a great read the fact that my favorite character got a happy ending where she raised a kid she rescued from a cult and had a kid of her own was just peak https://t.co/if4qptgJye
who do u think harry's favorite friends character is, i really think its phoebe https://t.co/P87RHJgR7R

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

Will always be my favorite FRIENDS character 😆🤗💖 https://t.co/hes2KsjfVL
@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.

love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends

How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.

Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok
@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

GM 🌞 enjoy your weekend, friends! 

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl. 

#CHAERYEONG #ITZY_SNEAKERS #ITZY_CHECKMATE #ITZY @ITZYofficial
One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.
@uson_adrian I'm glad that Mirishita will add friends😍😍✨✨

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar
Happy Birthday Ichigo! My favorite Bleach character who I’m glad is living a happy life and is able to smile a lot more! I hope you have a great day with your family and friends! 
#Bleach #HappyBirthdayIchigo #黒崎一護生誕祭2022 https://t.co/1lpr32VESQ
Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf

Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character

I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod. 

But eh, WHY THE HELL NOT?! I WANNA SUPPORT MY FRIENDS AND FAVORITE CREATORS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! EVEN IF IT IS USING A PARODY CHARACTER FOR IT!
When someone asks me who my favorite Friends character is https://t.co/kKb6sCFDNU
One of my favorite bits ever is when my friends are like "red you like nash" and I go "???? Who????? I hate that guy worst character in the franchise"
Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

KEROOOOO, please tell who’s your favorite character from FRIENDS? 🥹🥹🥹🥹 @KeremBursin https://t.co/tPxSbf0AuW
i need more #OMORI friends please 

my name is Liz or Eli and i am currently obsessed with OMORI and i need people to talk about it with. my favorite character is Basil!
I want that Rachel from friends hair cut cause she’s my favorite character but I really don’t trust no hair stylist in Florida
fuck your zodiac sign who was your favorite happy tree friends character
These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐

@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok
@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl. 

#CHAERYEONG #ITZY_SNEAKERS #ITZY_CHECKMATE #ITZY @ITZYofficial
One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar
Happy Birthday Ichigo! My favorite Bleach character who I’m glad is living a happy life and is able to smile a lot more! I hope you have a great day with your family and friends!

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf
do you think your favorite fictional character of all time would you like you or want to be friends with you

I have Darth Vader! My favorite Star Wars character! :D
We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

@Amyrosesimp1 Tails is my favorite character, and one of Amy's good friends. Why should she hate him? seeing Tails and Amy is cool. https://t.co/vDkSM6OOcp

It’s my birthday in 4 days! So tonight I’m treating myself to feeling fucking gorgeous while I hang out with my closest, most beloved friends for D&amp;D. 

I’m a bard called “Jaxi the Tabaxi” and she is my favorite character I have made. https://t.co/mrI14awkIl
Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Innocence doesn't get you far... 

Have a teaser (also my favorite voiceline) of a cover that'll be posted soon. Yes I will be posting covers again soon I swear!!!

Character with meow voice will be revealed soon. It's a friends character https://t.co/u86uzk4MzM
Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??
Johnny trying to get GMs to sign him after they found out Friends was his favorite show and Ross was his favorite character  https://t.co/43WY7UkYek
i think it kinda sucks th at my@only compliment is “ im going to put you in my mouth and chew you like gum “ whether its at my friends, a favorite character, or at someones art
One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character

I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod. 

But eh, WHY THE HELL NOT?! I WANNA SUPPORT MY FRIENDS AND FAVORITE CREATORS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! EVEN IF IT IS USING A PARODY CHARACTER FOR IT!
When someone asks me who my favorite Friends character is https://t.co/kKb6sCFDNU
One of my favorite bits ever is when my friends are like "red you like nash" and I go "???? Who????? I hate that guy worst character in the franchise"
Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

📺: https://t.co/DwEUgOdYYU https://t.co/iRT0jFuYtX
KEROOOOO, please tell who’s your favorite character from FRIENDS? 🥹🥹🥹🥹 @KeremBursin https://t.co/tPxSbf0AuW
i need more #OMORI friends please 

my name is Liz or Eli and i am currently obsessed with OMORI and i need people to talk about it with. my favorite character is Basil!
I want that Rachel from friends hair cut cause she’s my favorite character but I really don’t trust no hair stylist in Florida
fuck your zodiac sign who was your favorite happy tree friends character
These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐

@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok
@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl. 

#CHAERYEONG #ITZY_SNEAKERS #ITZY_CHECKMATE #ITZY @ITZYofficial
One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf
do you think your favorite fictional character of all time would you like you or want to be friends with you

I have Darth Vader! My favorite Star Wars character! :D
We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

@fiberopticduck Which reminds me, do you have any particular favorite character, whether it's Sienna or any of her friends?
@izzy900is @firefisteric Your favorite character doesn’t always have to be someone you can be friends with 

Like my favorite character is white purely off his personality but I’d hate White if he was real

steve harrington being my favorite character ever does not mean i have emotional attachment and trust issues born from always being the one protecting others instead of being protected by anyone, including friends and parents, what are you talking about, no def not.

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

You are badass, just like her! https://t.co/xhRsDodblY
@melissaCnavia

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!
@Bbexie1 QUICK

@Amyrosesimp1 Tails is my favorite character, and one of Amy's good friends. Why should she hate him? seeing Tails and Amy is cool. https://t.co/vDkSM6OOcp
Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz

It’s my birthday in 4 days! So tonight I’m treating myself to feeling fucking gorgeous while I hang out with my closest, most beloved friends for D&amp;D. 

I’m a bard called “Jaxi the Tabaxi” and she is my favorite character I have made. https://t.co/mrI14awkIl
Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Innocence doesn't get you far... 

Have a teaser (also my favorite voiceline) of a cover that'll be posted soon. Yes I will be posting covers again soon I swear!!!

Character with meow voice will be revealed soon. It's a friends character https://t.co/u86uzk4MzM
Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??
Johnny trying to get GMs to sign him after they found out Friends was his favorite show and Ross was his favorite character  https://t.co/43WY7UkYek
i think it kinda sucks th at my@only compliment is “ im going to put you in my mouth and chew you like gum “ whether its at my friends, a favorite character, or at someones art
One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character

I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod. 

But eh, WHY THE HELL NOT?! I WANNA SUPPORT MY FRIENDS AND FAVORITE CREATORS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! EVEN IF IT IS USING A PARODY CHARACTER FOR IT!
When someone asks me who my favorite Friends character is https://t.co/kKb6sCFDNU
One of my favorite bits ever is when my friends are like "red you like nash" and I go "???? Who????? I hate that guy worst character in the franchise"
Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

I want that Rachel from friends hair cut cause she’s my favorite character but I really don’t trust no hair stylist in Florida
fuck your zodiac sign who was your favorite happy tree friends character
These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐

@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok
@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

I have a favorite game I like to play w one of my friends called “how many beers” where I send him some character who’s fucked up and ask how beers would it take to sleep w them
I hope it was fun to look throughout my collection! I always have fun setting it up to share and display all together like this !! 🥺💕💕 crow has been my favorite character for almost 7 years now 😭he’s helped me a lot with expressing myself &amp; making friends with all of you!! https://t.co/bamXtRYnid
I drew my new favorite character from #theOwlHouse, The Collector. I love them so much, they is my newest son! I imagine after a bit, they and King are gonna be good friends! (before going Spinel from the Steven Universe Movie of course.) I can tell we're gonna have fun with them https://t.co/zjPoTGbHdf

We didn't play long but I'm thankful. :3 #Fortnite #NintendoSwitch #gaming #games https://t.co/6EGR1XKAI8
Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My least favorite thing in cartoons/movies are character misunderstandings

I don’t just mean like the “breakup” scene that’s in every kids movie. Like when characters are underestimated or they do something misinterpreted by their friends, etc

It makes rewatches so annoying
The Sanrio character of the hour is Still Small Tales!

A kind, timid child made of snow. Good friends with snow fairy, the mini snowman. Loves taking walks in the fluffy snow. The red muffler is its favorite!

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

coming from someone who's least favorite character is mafuyu, it's more like this
the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW
Imma send this video to my friends who talk sh*t about my favorite character just because their favorite lost to my mine https://t.co/aVa2mghuUi
@A_AMilne @bertie_lakeland My very favorite collection is pooh and friends. My favorite character is Eeyore. I do luv Pooh too.

@Trefter0 @mikuruVT My favorite has to be Razor, he’s someone who protects his friends and his lupical, he’s a very strong and sweet character 💕 https://t.co/i1x10kfxtt

Very educational

@fiberopticduck Which reminds me, do you have any particular favorite character, whether it's Sienna or any of her friends?
@izzy900is @firefisteric Your favorite character doesn’t always have to be someone you can be friends with 

Like my favorite character is white purely off his personality but I’d hate White if he was real

steve harrington being my favorite character ever does not mean i have emotional attachment and trust issues born from always being the one protecting others instead of being protected by anyone, including friends and parents, what are you talking about, no def not.

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions
Hiiii I’m new to the marvel fandom if anyone wants to be moots pls just dm me I need more marvel friends a little about me Is that my favorite marvel character is Loki &lt;3

You are badass, just like her! https://t.co/xhRsDodblY
@melissaCnavia

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz
It’s my birthday in 4 days! So tonight I’m treating myself to feeling fucking gorgeous while I hang out with my closest, most beloved friends for D&amp;D. 

I’m a bard called “Jaxi the Tabaxi” and she is my favorite character I have made. https://t.co/mrI14awkIl
Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Innocence doesn't get you far... 

Have a teaser (also my favorite voiceline) of a cover that'll be posted soon. Yes I will be posting covers again soon I swear!!!

Character with meow voice will be revealed soon. It's a friends character https://t.co/u86uzk4MzM
Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??
Johnny trying to get GMs to sign him after they found out Friends was his favorite show and Ross was his favorite character  https://t.co/43WY7UkYek
i think it kinda sucks th at my@only compliment is “ im going to put you in my mouth and chew you like gum “ whether its at my friends, a favorite character, or at someones art
One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod. 

But eh, WHY THE HELL NOT?! I WANNA SUPPORT MY FRIENDS AND FAVORITE CREATORS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! EVEN IF IT IS USING A PARODY CHARACTER FOR IT!

One of my favorite bits ever is when my friends are like "red you like nash" and I go "???? Who????? I hate that guy worst character in the franchise"
Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

I want that Rachel from friends hair cut cause she’s my favorite character but I really don’t trust no hair stylist in Florida
fuck your zodiac sign who was your favorite happy tree friends character
These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20

I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok
@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl.

@NhlanhlaDhlam10 @Thulani16V You mean this character assassination tactics by your favorite Mr #PhalaPhala and his thug friends
Probably my favorite of the Marvel D+ shows now. It feels so full of character and visual creativity. I love Kamala so much, as well as her family and friends. I love all the Muslim and Pakistan focus, great rep for people who often don’t get that. https://t.co/VvFtoXLDar

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
My favorite ship dynamic is when two characters aren't shipped at all and they're just friends because platonic relationships are normal and not every character needs to be shipped
@AzzyTheFurry My favorite ship dynamic is when two characters aren't shipped at all and they're just friends because platonic relationships are normal and not every character needs to be shipped

Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

Will always be my favorite FRIENDS character 😆🤗💖 https://t.co/hes2KsjfVL
@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character
@Touyarokii Sonic.
What can I say, the dude has been my favorite video game character since my childhood, for his personality, speed, and friends he hangs out with. https://t.co/vEo7EdJNrO

very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.

@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???

BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

coming from someone who's least favorite character is mafuyu, it's more like this
the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW
Imma send this video to my friends who talk sh*t about my favorite character just because their favorite lost to my mine https://t.co/aVa2mghuUi
@A_AMilne @bertie_lakeland My very favorite collection is pooh and friends. My favorite character is Eeyore. I do luv Pooh too.
if theres a large cast then any character tht my favorite character interacts a lot w/is friends w instantly becomes one of my faves as well.
@Trefter0 @mikuruVT My favorite has to be Razor, he’s someone who protects his friends and his lupical, he’s a very strong and sweet character 💕 https://t.co/i1x10kfxtt

@izzy900is @firefisteric Your favorite character doesn’t always have to be someone you can be friends with 

Like my favorite character is white purely off his personality but I’d hate White if he was real

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz

Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk

The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod.

Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀

I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!

@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM

@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

Loveless by Alice Oseman was definitely one of my favorite reads this year! Been begging my friends to read it. I love the highlight in the importance of friendships and valuing those as much as any romantic relationship. Sunil was probably my favorite character https://t.co/L2XTahkxLn
Alice is favorite character material. Up there with Shane and Kit. 😭😭😭 She is so pure and so good to all of her friends. In fact, it's a 3-way-tie with those three.
Also...that bitch Tonya needs to die. I will fight her. That cat did nothing wrong.

Despite being the second movie, this is the first Toy Story I watched. Woody immediately became my favorite character. His loyalty to Andy and his friends was inspirational. 

I do have a question: why Andy’s Mom wasn’t suspicious when Jessie and Bullseye joined the gang? 🤔 https://t.co/VQrBZCtlGf
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

Will always be my favorite FRIENDS character 😆🤗💖 https://t.co/hes2KsjfVL
@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character
@Touyarokii Sonic.
What can I say, the dude has been my favorite video game character since my childhood, for his personality, speed, and friends he hangs out with. https://t.co/vEo7EdJNrO

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

Here come the delightful friends from the drawer! They come out from the drawers, lured by their favorite scents, which vary from sweet to strange.

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!
Oh no, this is my friends favorite character… this might be a deal breaker tho😭💀 https://t.co/WUZFIGcpNk

coming from someone who's least favorite character is mafuyu, it's more like this
the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW
Imma send this video to my friends who talk sh*t about my favorite character just because their favorite lost to my mine https://t.co/aVa2mghuUi
@A_AMilne @bertie_lakeland My very favorite collection is pooh and friends. My favorite character is Eeyore. I do luv Pooh too.
if theres a large cast then any character tht my favorite character interacts a lot w/is friends w instantly becomes one of my faves as well.
@Trefter0 @mikuruVT My favorite has to be Razor, he’s someone who protects his friends and his lupical, he’s a very strong and sweet character 💕 https://t.co/i1x10kfxtt

@fiberopticduck Which reminds me, do you have any particular favorite character, whether it's Sienna or any of her friends?
@izzy900is @firefisteric Your favorite character doesn’t always have to be someone you can be friends with 

Like my favorite character is white purely off his personality but I’d hate White if he was real

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions
Hiiii I’m new to the marvel fandom if anyone wants to be moots pls just dm me I need more marvel friends a little about me Is that my favorite marvel character is Loki &lt;3

You are badass, just like her! https://t.co/xhRsDodblY
@melissaCnavia

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz

I’m a bard called “Jaxi the Tabaxi” and she is my favorite character I have made. https://t.co/mrI14awkIl
Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??
Johnny trying to get GMs to sign him after they found out Friends was his favorite show and Ross was his favorite character  https://t.co/43WY7UkYek
i think it kinda sucks th at my@only compliment is “ im going to put you in my mouth and chew you like gum “ whether its at my friends, a favorite character, or at someones art
One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod.

Barely any teams wanted to sign Johnny when they found out his favorite character from ‘Friends’ is…Ross

fuck your zodiac sign who was your favorite happy tree friends character
These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM

Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f

I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

My favorite ship dynamic is when two characters aren't shipped at all and they're just friends because platonic relationships are normal and not every character needs to be shipped

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

Will always be my favorite FRIENDS character 😆🤗💖 https://t.co/hes2KsjfVL
@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character
@Touyarokii Sonic.
What can I say, the dude has been my favorite video game character since my childhood, for his personality, speed, and friends he hangs out with. https://t.co/vEo7EdJNrO

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.

@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???

BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!

coming from someone who's least favorite character is mafuyu, it's more like this
the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW

@A_AMilne @bertie_lakeland My very favorite collection is pooh and friends. My favorite character is Eeyore. I do luv Pooh too.
if theres a large cast then any character tht my favorite character interacts a lot w/is friends w instantly becomes one of my faves as well.

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

Super late happy birthday to my dearest of dear friends @MisfitsAbyss ! drew his WoW character Lixie cheeb as regular (middle), as Lady Dimitrescu (left), as a cookie (right) and as BRS (bottom) 🔥✨also added her name in the style of her green flames and her favorite drink~ 🍷 https://t.co/f4ew0JMtbz

Loki is a character that I can ship with everyone. I thought they were a cute couple and I even read some fanfics from some of my friends. He's not my favorite ship but I hate the hate he gets and when I see someone attacking the ship I defend Sylki! https://t.co/D4wCuTEsaT
@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk

The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Kirby Smart sounds like a caveman who went to the future and is trying to explain why he loves his favorite Nintendo character to his friends.
really, ross is my least favorite friends character
what's your favorite friends character ????? :) mine is everyone

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩

I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69

Me to noob friends as he braves LWS3: so you’re going to know my favorite character in the game the moment you see them 

Him upon discovering them: it’s Aurene isn’t it.

My favorite characters in FFXIV are well known to my friends, but I will tell you now that my favorite character in WoW is Garrosh Hellscream. Like my other favs, he does not give a single fuck. https://t.co/bDEr9VfTz8
@QatajAwandah This is the first time I've had a character that I feel so attached to honestly. I don't know if it's the experience of playing as her for 800+ hours, or if she's just associated with good friends, or a combo of both, but it's all been great and Nadleeh is my favorite
I do this thing where when I watch a show I’ll try to see who would be my friends favorite character it’s fun
Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

My favorite ship dynamic is when two characters aren't shipped at all and they're just friends because platonic relationships are normal and not every character needs to be shipped

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!
Oh no, this is my friends favorite character… this might be a deal breaker tho😭💀 https://t.co/WUZFIGcpNk

the only sekai characters i dislike are the ones who are bad friends. there's nothing wrong with a character doing something bad, but both the media/characters AND fans should recognize that's bad https://t.co/ejOA4JcMjs https://t.co/GtQPzNeKTW

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂
I’m the last person you expected to work on an FNF mod.

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀

i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩

Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL

Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.

I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies.

It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe
Me to noob friends as he braves LWS3: so you’re going to know my favorite character in the game the moment you see them

My favorite characters in FFXIV are well known to my friends, but I will tell you now that my favorite character in WoW is Garrosh Hellscream. Like my other favs, he does not give a single fuck. https://t.co/bDEr9VfTz8
@QatajAwandah This is the first time I've had a character that I feel so attached to honestly. I don't know if it's the experience of playing as her for 800+ hours, or if she's just associated with good friends, or a combo of both, but it's all been great and Nadleeh is my favorite
I do this thing where when I watch a show I’ll try to see who would be my friends favorite character it’s fun
Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

My favorite ship dynamic is when two characters aren't shipped at all and they're just friends because platonic relationships are normal and not every character needs to be shipped

Dragon Age friends… send your favorite character/OC/art photos (smutty art also very allowed! 😂😂) and/or just tell me about your OCs! Need happiness and distraction in a BIG way today 😔🖤
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin
if my friends watch twd i know theyre gonna hate my favorite character 😭
my friends fav charavter w my favorite character (ranaya) https://t.co/jtKb5Bcxvy
@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.
Not trying to lick all senior artist or big acc artist, but i never have regret playing genshin and follow them until i got the chance to become their friends. They taught me what real fans do to have fun with our favorite character and ships, inviting me to work with them, https://t.co/qoJUI0kk9J

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…
i judge people based on their favorite friends character

it’s funny how my other friend just kept buying me koya related things that they become my favorite bt21 character and my friends recognizing koya as mine oh yeaa https://t.co/wFc2vjOoqe
so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️
"Sure we're friends, but are we close enough friends that it wouldn't be weird to send them the really good lewd art I just saw of their favorite character?"
The Sanrio character of the hour is Hikida Shiaita!

folks keep on asking me my opinion on self-insert fanfic and allow me to finally answer: 

I don’t give a shit. Literally every single person pictures their favorite character as real and their friend at some point. It’s a pretty normal thing. Y/N it up friends!!!
Oh no, this is my friends favorite character… this might be a deal breaker tho😭💀 https://t.co/WUZFIGcpNk

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I absolutely love Strange New Worlds. Ortegas is by far one of my favorite characters. Intelligent, fearless, a bit of a smart-ass, but always looking out for her friends, she is an amazing character. I look forward to seeing her in the coming seasons!

@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

 EXCEPT ROSS :) fuck him
@birdjayreads This is a trilogy I have read at least half a dozen times if not more. I've recommended it to so many friends who have loved it. It's just... so freaking good. who is your favorite character?! Have you read Pacat's Dark Rise yet??

One of my favorite character traits about Argyle is that he wears a bunch of friendship bracelets (that he made) in case he ever makes friends so he can give them one... Yes this is canon https://t.co/DPt9tPd5FO
Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
drop your favorite duffy and friends character! mine is cookie i loveh er sosoosooo mu ch
Great @spittinchiclets episode with new CBJ sniper Johnny Gaudreau. Best question was (paraphrasing) @BizNasty2point0 asking Johnny how many teams bailed out when the found out Ross was his favorite Friends character. https://t.co/wkC9s5G9FZ
One of my friends favorite character from Kingdom Hearts is Xion and as a joke, every time he talks about her, I'm like; "...who?" 😂 "oh your Kingdom Hearts OC, right?" 😂

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying
getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀

i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩

Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta

Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe

@QatajAwandah This is the first time I've had a character that I feel so attached to honestly. I don't know if it's the experience of playing as her for 800+ hours, or if she's just associated with good friends, or a combo of both, but it's all been great and Nadleeh is my favorite
I do this thing where when I watch a show I’ll try to see who would be my friends favorite character it’s fun
Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…

so that when my character died in the next stream it’d hurt more. and that’s fun and funny and i love how much marriage truthing there is (shoutout jc, first marriage truther)

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki. I already mentioned liking the team 'straight man' but to look out for your friends in a crapsack world like CSM's is even more admirable. favorite supporting character. https://t.co/bsu56FqtBo
@josh_saitogami Overcame my fear of auditioning and my stiffness in the booth, developed many character voices, booked some cool projects and my personal favorite, made many awesome friends on here ❤️

Introducing a new social service where I cook a meal of your choice and put it on a plate in front of a laptop for you so you can pretend to be having a romantic dinner with your favorite fictional character for the people who lack cooking skills and really like imaginary friends
@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

@crazydog1435 you should watch Across the Universe, its a really good movie even without the music. its set around a pair of friends during the vietnam war and uses songs by the Beatles! :D, im not describing it well but character limit yk makes it difficult :/ Its my favorite movie ever thoug
I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends

These babies had their 1st experience of straight out racism from big birds friends. It’s hard as an adult to experience mean hatful people so just imagine your favorite childhood character treating your 5year old self less than human because of your skin tone. #seasameplace
All my twitter friends and just… everyone with bird sonas, tell me your favorite type of way to have the wings on the character! Hand wings, back wings, wings under their arms with talons at the end, etc, give me ideas! Pwease and thamk chu ^v^
Honestly! My friends are reading a snippet of my WIP and they keep talking about the atmosphere and worldbuilding but I just wanna know who their favorite character is https://t.co/nBR89k1moV
How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying

I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.

Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp

@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM

Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok

@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

GM 🌞 enjoy your weekend, friends! 

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU
@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.

friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.

@QatajAwandah This is the first time I've had a character that I feel so attached to honestly. I don't know if it's the experience of playing as her for 800+ hours, or if she's just associated with good friends, or a combo of both, but it's all been great and Nadleeh is my favorite
I do this thing where when I watch a show I’ll try to see who would be my friends favorite character it’s fun
Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.

Hartley is my favorite character bc she’s lovely and someone I’d be friends with in real life
@FevenAmbaye Sadie sinks character is a fan favorite! she’s like top 3 best characters on the show. Going THROUGH it but the strongest and bravest person. Sacrifices herself for her friends a lot. a lot of trauma lol. And 001…well… you know… he’s hot. 💀 but that’s all I got for him
@duhfected All my friends say I'm just like Dustin because I'm very smart and the comic relief so very accurate also my favorite character is Dustin

@OriginalFunko Favorite is definitely Hugsy. Legendary Friends character
here’s my personal favorite 🥰

character a: killed all of character b’s friends and loved ones
character b: becomes so obsessed with getting revenge that they sacrifice all their morals to achieve it and end up irreversibly corrupted
What better way to spend your summer with your friends? Like a scene in your favorite teen romance novel about a girl who develops feelings for this boy and can't stop thinking about him. Doesn't that sound cliche? But what if I told you that the main character is actually me? https://t.co/YlqJ6Y5FWd https://t.co/xTstSLiknY
Some rapid fire ones, wasn't really involved in this one, just watched it happen lol, 3 of my friends who lived in the same house, we're having a conversation on their favorite DBZ character. Two of them said Krillin was their favorite, while my one crazy friend said Vegeta.

@SilasIsBarking Curse is cool.
Not my personal favorite but I like how he has horror without being murderous.

Tbh murder is scary, but after about 5 times you just become desensitized to “this character but he kills innocent people including his friends” creepypastas. Curse isn’t that and I…

it’s amazing to here that my friends do have favorite moments from my lore because it shows they care
very wholesome #fnaf story. 
My brother walked up to me while I was drawing and showed me a fnaf video of sun and moon drop. He then asked me to draw him and Moon drop (his favorite character) as friends!
Thanks FNaF SB, you made my little brother's day today. https://t.co/5BtycHBgH1
@heathen_king @79SemiFinalist My favorite Robin. Analytical. Balancing a real life/friends. Driven by his own sense of justice not by Trauma. Even after losing so much. It actually hurts my heart what they did with this character. How they are treating the relationship with Stephanie.
@Buggiesjancy THEOOOOO 🥰 also Jughead, Nick, and Ambrose. I'm not a HUGE Friends fan, but Chandler is my favorite character.
With that being said, I changed back to Stari just because he is my favorite character I ever created. I have seen the hurtful things and the harsh things said about me from others whom I trusted and considered friends. And for those if your reading, shame on you.
love tagging friends with art of their favorite character
every day i have to wake up and contend with the fact that my favorite character is a little woodland creature that giggles girlishly and was meant to frolic in a field with friends and throw flowers around in a disgustingly cute idyllic manner but is deeply traumatized instead
@KWashingtonBX He's been coming on general hospital for years. After he stated he was a fan of the show and Sonny was his favorite character. They had him be a reporter outside of one of Sonny's trials. Now it looks like he has a recurring role as one of Sonny's friends???
From Jane ready to trow her friends under the bus for a room, Bruce and Amy as a tournament commentator to probable my new favorite character in the show: Dan is just amazing. https://t.co/Um2JY7yHyJ
BONUS because I want to gush about this quad instead of just dropping a picture w/o context. First comes #aki.

@Espeze32 If it is suited, then definitely do it. It's my favorite part of the books. Even if it is a favorite character. Feels like I'm getting revenge on the world for taking so many of my friends and family.  Guess you're right, sounds sadistic.  🤷
@hearing_girl @peppersagooddog @Idzie Theyre usually wearing their favorite character/interest too. I was hanging out with older friends and their kid had an Elsa towel. Had a whole conversation about it. A lot of times it's just agreeing with what they said/asking more questions

I’m re-watching #TheWheelOfTime - I still take issue with the amount of changes made, but it’s an enjoyable show.
I think episode three is my favorite, absolutely love the character building and dark friend reveal. Hoping to see way more dark friends in season 2. https://t.co/GkU4fnULLk
The Sanrio character of the hour is Paradise Lives!

Platypus Kamo Kamo and echidna Harry are great friends. Kamo Kamo is quiet and goes at his own pace. His favorite phrase is 'kamo, ne' (probably, right?). The curious Harry is small but strong!

Like, it's like listening to people info dump, but it's the same kinda info dumping and debating and character/story charting you'd do with your friends and now your favorite streamers are having fun doing it. Not just that, but providing ample fodder for your creative thoughts
@CastlesofImagin Not all of the changes are bad. I think Keldor works better in this new series and Adam trusts his friends rather than lying to them. Krass is my favorite new character
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends
I don’t trust people who’s favorite character is Ross #Friends

How I see it: People can tell you more about their favorite tv series character/sport athlete than they can tell you about their current State/Gov representatives. Most just want to get faded and not talk about it all. Imagine talking education/knowledge with your friends🇺🇸💪😅🌐
@HiroRwar smiling friends had my favorite deconstruction of nihilism where a character literally shouts "nothing matters cuz we're all gonna die someday", and then is so scared to die a literal second later that he pisses himself crying

getting real tired of these anemo boys with dead friends and i say that with venti as my favorite character 💀💀
@SayoriPlushVlog Can we be friends your my favorite character from ddlc
i didn’t invent imaginary friends, but i would pretend like i was a character in my favorite fantasy worlds. i still do https://t.co/Aan0F8Bm20
I think Pathfinder was the episode that brought me &amp; a lot of friends back. It had a fan favorite character helming the story, and it returned focus from the episodic content to the story of a ship stranded on the far side of the galaxy, decades from home.
@myjooha Miss ma’am. I don’t think he’s a boogeyman. But that’s doesn’t mean he deserves Daons heart. As I said them being friends is best for both of them. 

And I actually love Jaemin! He’s my favorite character in the story. Even though I don’t ship him. I love complex characters like
My favorite character in The Big Bang Theory is Howard.
In The Simpsons, that's Bart, if you consider main characters, Jessica otherwise.
In Futurama, it's Bender. 
In Malcolm, It's Hal, or Malcolm.
In Friends, it's Joey.
Advise: find friends who send you NSFW fanarts of your favorite character when you have a really bad day. Send tweet.
Long time no post! But I got to spend the week with some friends from out of state, and we had a blast! One of the things we did was go into a Build a Bear, and decided as a group to make bears based off of a favorite character! I decided to make mine a Hop inspired bear :) https://t.co/EUaYkYuMYp
Who's your favorite FRIENDS character?
@milkyway080 My favorite Sanrio character is Cinnamonroll because he’s so cute and kind helping his loving friends. Plus he can make yummy treats and is always helpful and honest. Cinnamonroll is a precious puppy with a heart of gold🥰 https://t.co/o54FY7jJrw
@jakedimare Blue check account asked who everyone's favorite Star Trek character to hang out with (just as friends) would be,

And twitter selected the Correct Answer.
my favorite thing to do it is to watch a tv show with my friends and we all decide which character we relate to the most
@brownandsweet7 My favorite character to play as is Game and Watch. There is just something satisfying about being good at an obscure character nobody uses and trolling your friends. 🤣🤣
@Nik_Keisuke Favorite arc? Character? Match? lol, I need Haikyuu friends.
Just watched the end of stranger things season 4 and now I know why all my friends said I would love Eddie... such an epic character! Also 11 has to be one of my favorite female protagonists right up there with Ellen Ripley!
@Nay0505 I prefer this theory tbh cuz one of my least favorite endings for things is when a character seperates from their friends and loved ones for any reason 😩😩 i hate that bro we spent so long getting to know them and the group dynamics and now theyre alone 😩😩
Who is your favorite character in Armor Beast and his friends beside Destroya, All and other powerful gods. https://t.co/fKaCHYXzJM
okay thats probably it tho hopefully u guys go listen to ur favorite song or play a game with ur friends and relax or something instead of being so upsetti spaghetti over a thread on stan twitter about a fictional character.
Xinyan and Kazuha are friends is my favorite bit of character lore to come out of the new event so far https://t.co/j7GJx544Ok

@masked_investor Damn I didnt watch Friends cuz I couldnt relate. Who was your favorite character on Martin?! #Martin
Today’s movie pick Vision Quest (85) was a favorite amongst my friends in highschool. Everyone was crushing on Linda (Clara) Fiorentino. The hot older girl that Matthew Modine’s character Louden Swain fell head over heels for. Also staring Michael Schoeffling and Ronny Cox. https://t.co/Vg9Bv2Kj5f
Who was your favorite character from Friends!? #Friends
I started ignoring the taste of the few friends I got in the real world lmao. Either start hating when I like anime for something that's not action or something super complex, or upset because I just hit episode 270+ of one piece and my favorite character Robin since alabasta
We can guess your least favorite Friends character based on your mental age!

GM 🌞 enjoy your weekend, friends! 

This is an art from several years ago (2016-7). Some of you might identify a JRPG character here 🤔💀

What are some of your favorite JRPGs?
Mine might be FFX, SMT III: Nocturne &amp; Persona 2: Innocent Sin https://t.co/w6XmAu4XJa
Chaeryeong's favorite Friends character is Rachel 😄 she's now watching Gossip Girl.

One of favorite character archetypes is the himbo friend who always means well, tries their best to support their friends, and has a heart of gold, that’s why Joey Wheeler is my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! character. Although Seto Kaiba will always have a special place in my heart https://t.co/o5mYBQaKuL
@BanyaLaplace only know Persona 4 or Persona 5. I'm happy them coming to steam means more friends will play 3 though!! I wish they released an updated FES with FEMC but that's just me :,) Oh oh!! Who's your favorite Devil Survivor character if you don't mind me asking?
Hi, I'm D.M./Dae/Darling, and I write erotic romance of many...many kinds. My favorite side character I have written is probably one I haven't even written yet but have plans for in my WIP. The FMC and her become best friends while they're both in a dark sex society/cult. https://t.co/KX7qbpYoEU

@KottkrigArt one of my favorite story beats for my own character was encountering a guy who hated his guts from the start, and he just had to deal with it. it took a year or so and a lot of work, but they're friends now.
friends! when reading ur favorite comic character who’s voice do you hear?
I really love pokemon, and l loved PKMN Moon. One of my favorite characters being Hau. So l decided to draw my Haunter and his Decidieye being buddies. 
My character always saw Hau as a little brother, so she was happy Haunter and Decidueye were friends. https://t.co/I1TVURs1v6
It kinda pisses me off when people talk shit about things you like, like we're watching the Winter Soldier (my friends favorite movie) and I'm just reading Carol &amp; Wanda friends fic and my friend says "I don't like her (carol). I just don't like her character"
Luz: Fully bought in, the characters are all her friends, loves to scream and clutch onto whoever closest, after the movies over she either wallows about her favorite character didn’t deserve to die or rates how datable the monster was.
Plus, she also mentions which (Jewish) character of hers she'd be friends with in real life! https://t.co/mi7yawVR69
One of my favorite parts of writing is coming up with character names. I've used friends, family and plenty of authors that have inspired me: @VinceFlynncom @KyleMillsAuthor @BradThor @RyanSteckAuthor. I also used @ThatKevinSmith. Who else wants in?  #thrillers #amwriting
More of my favorite Friends character. Oh, and open carry is legal in Ohio.
@uson_adrian I'm glad that Mirishita will add friends😍😍✨✨

I'm excited about who my favorite character will be!!😍😍✨✨

@Teagy7 I mean why do y'all lie with no plan? Sam Winchester is your favorite character for the duration of your tweet? Because there's no evidence of that on your tl. But here you are, manufacturing outrage against Jared just like all of your deancas friends. It's the hypocrisy for me. https://t.co/gKMqD2Vvfe
Me to noob friends as he braves LWS3: so you’re going to know my favorite character in the game the moment you see them 

Him upon discovering them: it’s Aurene isn’t it.

My favorite characters in FFXIV are well known to my friends, but I will tell you now that my favorite character in WoW is Garrosh Hellscream. Like my other favs, he does not give a single fuck. https://t.co/bDEr9VfTz8
OMGGG A FRIENDS WATCHER TOO ????? nice meeting you!!! ^___^ who’s your favorite character on friends ???? https://t.co/iPl4jEUnFu
@QatajAwandah This is the first time I've had a character that I feel so attached to honestly. I don't know if it's the experience of playing as her for 800+ hours, or if she's just associated with good friends, or a combo of both, but it's all been great and Nadleeh is my favorite
I do this thing where when I watch a show I’ll try to see who would be my friends favorite character it’s fun
Oh man, my XC2 cutscene rewatch has brought me to one of my favorite scenes, where one character confesses their love to another, and the second character's all like, "I love you too! I love all my friends!"
@Yellow_Motion King is my favorite character and I'm so happy that they added his Tekken 2 costume. Especially since my friends and I use to play Tekken 2 all the time back in the day. Tekken is definitely my favorite fighting game franchise.
@fakexluffy I was waiting for you to ask this 

Favorite Character: Iori
Favorite Arc: idk the names 
Favorite Fight: Kohei Vs Iori 💀
Best Girl: Thry all fire but the older sister the worst proly

@reacttothek would you rather be your favorite character from a show or be friends with them?
@DemingLiam @ShaddleA @HoodieMorr @WtfImgvids Mf it just looks like his friends dressed up as his favorite character and gave him the best soup ever
everyone who's favorite thomas and friends character is/was percy is a bottom now and you can't prove me wrong
New Girl, Netflix: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Danielle wanted to rewatch the show. Zooey Deschanel isn’t my favorite - we get it… your quirky. 🙄 That said, the show is the the show that Friends wishes it was. A gold-standard show for future ensemble sitcoms. Winston is an all-time character. https://t.co/TtHJvJ2CYO
Favorite Character: Yami
Favorite Arc: Spade arc 
Favorite Fight: Everyone vs Lucifero
Best Girl: Noelle
Best Antagonist: Patri
Favorite Moment: Asta and Liebe becoming friends https://t.co/ImNIUvaMQ9
